## Interactive Connectivity Establishment (RFC 5245)

ICE using [jlaine's aioice library](https://github.com/jlaine/aioice). 

I edited the code so that the terminal outputs are more "pretty." Candidates are organized and in a different color, and the connection messages are more obvious.

aioice is a library for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (RFC 5245) in Python. It is built on top of asyncio, Python's standard asynchronous I/O framework.

Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is useful for applications that establish peer-to-peer UDP data streams, as it facilitates NAT traversal. Typical usecases include SIP and WebRTC.
